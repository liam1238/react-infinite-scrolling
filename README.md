# Search Engine Of Books By Name 

This project is a simple react project that get books name from all over the world using open libarary api.

In this project iv'e used react hooks like: useState, useEffect, useRef and useCallback, as well as my own hook: useBookSearch.

We are getting 100 books names in every search and if there are more, we will load them after we see the last element. 

If there are no more books to show, we will see the text "THE END!".

This project is also handling errors that may apper while searching.
